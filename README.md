Intl Data
=========

This component contains data of the ICU library in two different versions:

* One data set in the [resource bundle format version 1.*] [1], which can be
  read using ICU 4.0 and later.

* One data set in the [resource bundle format version 2.*][2], which can be
  read using ICU 4.4 and later.

These data are used by the Symfony [Intl component][3].
